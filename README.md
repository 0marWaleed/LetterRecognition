Thanks for pointing that out! Based on your GitHub repo at [0marWaleed/LetterRecognition](https://github.com/0marWaleed/LetterRecognition), here's the **correct file structure** and a fully updated **Markdown README** — ready to copy and paste:

```markdown
# 🧠 Letter Recognition using Machine Learning

A machine learning project to classify handwritten capital letters (A–Z) based on 16 numerical features. The final model is deployed with **Streamlit**, **Flask**, and **Tkinter** interfaces.

---

## 📊 Dataset

- **Source**: UCI Machine Learning Repository – [Letter Recognition Data Set](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/letter+recognition)
- **Classes**: 26 uppercase English letters (A–Z)
- **Features**: 16 numerical attributes per sample (extracted from images)

---

## 🧪 Project Workflow

1. **Preprocessing**
   - Convert data from `.data` to structured format using Pandas
   - Normalize/scale features
   - Encode target labels (A–Z)
   - Split into training/testing sets

2. **Modeling**
   - Trained using `Support Vector Machine (SVM)` (best-performing model)
   - Model serialized with `pickle` to `letter_classification.pkl`

3. **Deployment**
   - Built 3 frontends using:
     - `Streamlit` for quick interactive demos
     - `Flask` for web deployment
     - `Tkinter` for local desktop GUI
